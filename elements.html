<!-- Text stuff -->
    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>This is <b>bold</b> and this is <strong>strong</strong>. This is <i>italic</i> and this is <em>emphasized</em>. This is <sup>superscript</sup> text and this is <sub>subscript</sub> text. This is <u>underlined</u> and this is code: <code>for (;;) { ... }</code>. Finally, this is a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
    <hr />
    <header>
        <h2>Heading with a Subtitle</h2>
        <p>Subtitle text is italicized</p>
    </header>
    <p>This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle, most commonly referred to as: the paragraph. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>

    <blockquote>If your icons have semantic meaning, you’ll need to manually add a few things so that your icon is appropriately accessible: aria-hidden attribute + Provide a text alternative inside a <code>span</code> (or similar) element. Also include appropriate CSS to visually hide the element while keeping it accessible to assisitive technologies +
    title attribute on the icon to provide a tooltip for sighted mouse users. </blockquote>
