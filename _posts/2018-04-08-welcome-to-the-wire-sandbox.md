Hi there! Welcome to the WI+RE sandbox! This is WI+RE's place to play around and experiment with web publishing. We can explore all kinds of things here - protoypes, playlists, coding, editing, html, css, web animations - you name it!

#### Inspirational quotes on learning, creativity, and design from the WI+RE team

> When everyone in the classroom, teacher and students recognizes that they are responsible for creating a learning community together, learning is at its most meaningful and useful.
> - <cite>bell hooks, Teaching Critical Thinking: Practical Wisdom</cite>


>Dream a little before you think. 
>
> _Toni Morrison_

> Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.
>
> _Pablo Picasso_

>Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,  
the world offers itself to your imagination,  
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting –  
over and over announcing your place  
in the family of things.
>
>_Mary Oliver_, "Wild Geese"

>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.

>_Steve Jobs_

>The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.
>
>_Sylvia Plath_

>You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down.
>
>_Annie Dillard_

>We live in a bewildering world.
>
>_Stephen Hawking_

>Too busy watering my own grass to notice if yours is greener.

### An introduction to editing posts in Jekyll and markdown

We may also use this space to do more process oriented posts and share some of our prototypes - we'll see!

For now, let's use this as an opportunity to talk about how posts work.

You'll find the code for this post in the `_posts` directory. Take a look at the code repository at [https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox) and see if you can find the code for this post.

The code for this post is written in something called markdown, which is kind of like a simplified version of html. We use both markdown and html (and some ruby) in our posts.

Here's a quick [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get you started.

#### Ready for a challenge?

1. Make a fork of the WI+RE site.
2. In your fork, find the `_posts` directory
3. Edit this post - it is called `2018-04-08-welcome-to-the-wire-sandbox.md`
4. Add a quote you like to the section below! Check out the previous examples to see how the formatting works! Also add yourself to the list of authors in the metadata at the top of the page.
5. Check out your change! It should be posted to the version of the site that is now hosted on your github pages account. The url should look something like this: `https://yourgithubusername.github.io/wire-sandbox/` - did it work? If not, find someone to help troubleshoot!
6. Like your changes? Create a pull request to get your changes added back in to the sandbox site! After you make your pull request, you'll need to find Shannon, Taylor, or Doug to merge your changes into the sandbox.
