<p>You've done your research and found sources that support your argument. Now it's time to let your readers know how these sources have contributed to your work! Here are a few of the basics for integrating citations into your writing:</p></div>
<br><br><br>

### Citation Structures:

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="expandable">
    <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 hoverable blue lighten-5">
    <div class="col s12 m6"><p><b>Make a claim without a quote</b></p></div>
    <div class="col s12 m6"><p> <markgreen>Claim</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>). </p></div>
    <div><center><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></center></div>
    </div>
       <div class="collapsible-body">
       <div class="intro"><b>Example:</b></div>
       <div class="col s12 m5;m8"><p class="two"> <markgreen>Some view cities as the storehouse of culture and creativity, and propose that urbanization is a consequence of the attractiveness of these social benefits</markgreen> (<markyellow>Mumford, 1961</markyellow>). </p></div>
       <div><p>  Oftentimes you do not need to directly quote a source to convey its conclusions or arguments – and some disciplines discourage quoting directly! Rather you can paraphrase the main point of a paper in your own words and provide an in-text citation. A benefit of using this strategy is that you can offer support for a claim without using a whole paragraph to introduce and frame a quote. You should make sure that you fully understand the paper's argument and that you are following university citation guidelines before attempting to paraphrase something from a paper.

      </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 hoverable blue lighten-5">
    <div class="col s12 m6"><p><b>Make a claim that is supported by two or more sources</b></p></div>
    <div class="col s12 m6"><p> <markgreen>Claim</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation 1</markyellow>; <markyellow>Citation 2</markyellow>).</p> </div>
    <div><center><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></center></div>
    </div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
      <div class="intro"><b>Example:</b></div>
      <div class="col s12 m5;m8"><p class="two"> <markgreen>Reviews of this literature concede difficulty in making direct comparisons of emission levels across different sets of analysis</markgreen> (<markyellow>Bader and Bleischwitz, 2009</markyellow>; <markyellow>Kennedy et al., 2009</markyellow>; <markyellow>Ramaswami et al., 2012</markyellow>). </p></div>
       <div><p> Sometimes there’s not just one source that perfectly supports your claim, or there are two major publications that deserve credit for providing evidence on a topic. This is a perfect time to use multiple citations. You can cite two, three, or more sources, but remember to cite only the publications that are most prominent so as not to clutter up your paper.</p></div>
      </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 hoverable blue lighten-5">
      <div class="col s12 m6"><p><b>Make a claim that has been supported in multiple contexts</b></p></div>
      <div class="col s12 m6"><p> <markgreen>Context 1</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>), <markgreen>Context 2</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>), <markgreen>Context 3</markgreen> (<markyellow>Citation</markyellow>). </p></div>
      <div><center><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></center></div>
      </div> 
      <div class="collapsible-body">
      <div class="intro"><b>Example:</b></div>
      <div class="col s12 m5;m8"><p class="two"> <markgreen>These results are supported by more recent research on transportation energy consumption</markgreen>  (<markyellow>Liddle, 2014</markyellow>), <markgreen>electricity consumption in buildings</markgreen> (<markyellow>Lariviere and Lafrance, 1999</markyellow>), <markgreen>and overall urban GHG emissions</markgreen> (<markyellow>Marcotullio et al., 2013b</markyellow>). </p></div>
       <div><p>Use this citation strategy when you want to show that a body of research has found support for some claim across several different contexts. This can show the robustness of an effect or phenomenon and can give your claim some added validity.</p></div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 hoverable blue lighten-5">

     <div> <p>While block or even whole-sentence citations are rare in most research papers in the science and social science disciplines, there is often a need to quote specific terms or phrases that were first coined by a certain source or that were well-explained in a specific paper.</p></div>

      <div><p>The appropriateness of quoting directly from a text varies widely across fields and document types. However, if it makes sense for your field and your purpose, a direct quotation can bring attention to specific language in your source.</p></div>

### Specific Citation Strategies:
  
  <p>You can use the structures provided above to cite and support all sorts of claims! Take a look at these examples of how you can use these strategies to help your reader understand the sources and how you are using them.</p>
  <ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="expandable">
   <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 green lighten-5">
      <div><p><b><font size="5">Summarize your source</font></b></p></div>
      <div class="col s12 m5;m8"><font size="4"><p class="two" style='background:white;'><markgreen>The studies of Newman and Kenworthy</markgreen> (<markyellow>1989, 1999</markyellow>) <markgreen>demonstrate a negative relationship between population density and transportation fuel use</markgreen>.</p></font>
      </div>
      <div><p><font size="4">You will help your reader understand your points better if you summarize the key points of a study. Describe the strengths or weaknesses a specific source that has been pivotal in your field. Describe the source's specific methodology, theory, or approach. Be sure to still include a citation. If you mention the name of the author in your text, you still need to provide the date of the study in a parenthetical citation.</font></p></div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 green lighten-5">
      <div><p><b><font size="5">Cite a method</font></b></p></div>
      <div class="col s12 m5;m8"><p class="two" style='background:white;'><font size="4"><markgreen>Despite the popularity of the</markgreen> <markyellow>WUP indicators</markyellow>, <markgreen>they have been routinely criticized because the methodology relies on local- andcountry-speciﬁc deﬁnitions of bounding urban areas, resulting in of ten incomparable and widely diver-gent deﬁnitions of the population, density thresholds, or administrative/political units designated</markgreen> (<markyellow>Sat-terthwaite, 2007</markyellow>). </font></p></div>
       <div><p><font size="4">This is an easy way to give credit to a source that has provided some evidence for the vailidity of a method or questionaire. Readers can reference your citation if they are interested in knowing more about the method and its standing in the current literature.</font></p></div>

    </li>  
    <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header row z-depth-2 green lighten-5">

       <div><p><font size="4">This is one of the most important techniques for creating an effective literature review.

    </ul>
  


<p> These are only a few of the ways you can use souces to provide support for your argument. Explore other papers in your field to get even more ideas on how to effectively integrate sources into your writing. </p>

### Heads Up:

<p>Citation styles vary from field to field. You will want to make sure that you have a grasp for the citation style most commonly used in the discipline you’re writing in (for example, is it Geology or Microbiology, Musicology or History?). Find a representative paper in your field and take a look at how they use and integrate parenthetical citations. For example, Humanities articles tend to use direct quotations to integrate their sources whereas science-based academic papers do not.
