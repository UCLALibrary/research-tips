One of the many wonderful things about Library Instruction West was getting a chance to explore the [University of Utah's Marriott Library](http://lib.utah.edu/index).

### Happy hallways

Oddly, a hallway was a highlight for me, but perhaps that shouldn't be so odd - perhaps more library hallways should get this kind of attention. I loved the big red spinning things - though do be careful if you decide to [try to sit in one](https://twitter.com/LibrarianHollyL/status/741029315567968257). I also really liked this placement of browsing collections, as well as the booth-style study lounges along the side (with ample outlets and fancy kitchen countertops!).

### Academic Services Hub

The library has [a suite of academic services](http://lib.utah.edu/services/), including a research consultation space, little cubicles for campus advising, and a [digital scholarship lab](http://lib.utah.edu/services/digital-scholarship-lab/index.php).

There were plenty of cozy chairs all around, as well as ample group study space. Many of the group study rooms came outfitted with iMacs.

As I wandered around, I found a large, open floorplan computer lab with a few surprises - an accessibility room adjacent to the lab, a small collection of linux workstations, and ....

a tidy little area for 3D printing.

The social events at the conference are certainly worth a mention, in particular the [Tracy Aviary](http://tracyaviary.org/), which featured these lovely folks: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting social at Tracy Aviary.

this rather elegant creature:

and quite more Macaw-flying-right-over-head than I'm used to:

All in all, a splendidly organized conference.
