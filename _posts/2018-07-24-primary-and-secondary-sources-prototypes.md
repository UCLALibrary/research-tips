Here are some early prototypes for [Wheel of Sources](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/primary-secondary/), our activity on primary and secondary sources.

### Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to...
1. Identify a source as primary or secondary given a specific research topic or discipline.
2. Identify a source that one research topic would treat as primary, and another research topic would treat as secondary.
3. Generate ideas for types of primary sources that may be relevant to their research area.

This prototype was made using Scratch, a simple coding interface developed at MIT. It demonstrates a potential drag-and-drop mechanism and an early example of level-design.

This paper prototype tries to get at the second of the three learning outcomes. With this one, we focused on fleshing out the content with six researchers and three artifcacts. We  incorporated descriptions of a variety of researchers (some real, some fictional) to show that researchers come from many different educational levels and disciplinary backgrounds.
