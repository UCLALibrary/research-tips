place: San Jose, CA
abstract: "Academic libraries are always changing in order to stay relevant with the unique and dynamic needs of users. Historically, reference was offered as a single service point within the library. However, as libraries continue to evolve, we have seen variations from this “traditional” model. Many libraries are considering offering no reference desk, reference service points at different locations on campus, or reference offered from librarian offices only, among other new models. The California Academic Reference Librarians Discussion Interest Group South (CARLDIG-S) has surveyed academic libraries in California to gauge the current state of “reference as place” and invited presenters to discuss different types of reference service models. Through this discussion session, participants will have the opportunity to learn the results of CARLDIG-S’s “Reference as Place” survey, hear from presenters about the current state of reference at their own institutions, and contribute their thoughts on varied reference models. Presenters will share their own experiences of transitioning between different models, starting new service points, and the benefits and disadvantages of each model to stimulate discussion among attendees."
