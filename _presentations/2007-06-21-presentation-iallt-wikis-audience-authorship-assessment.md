meetingname: International Association of Language Learning Technology

place: Boston, MA
abstract: "This session looks at the role of audience, authorship, and assessment in two very different wiki projects – a semester long project in a Japanese course that linked students at a distance and a short term project in a single section of a French course. The presenters will discuss the flexibility of wikis as teaching and learning tools, demonstrating the range of audiences, authorship models, and assessment strategies teachers can consider when designing wiki projects. Participants will leave with new ideas for language learning wikis and a framework to use when planning and reviewing collaborative writing projects."
