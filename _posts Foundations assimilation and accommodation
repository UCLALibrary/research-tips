            </div>
            <p class="card-text">Terry Heick explains how students learn by filling and modifying "schemas," or knowledge bases, with new experiences and information they come across. Assimilation refers to the addition of new information to previous bases of knowledge, while accommodation refers to altering previous bases of knowledge to fit new information. Heick outlines the ways in which teachers can make classrooms schema-friendly so that students can direct their own learning experience.</p>

                <blockquote>"Through assimilation, we take in new information or experiences and incorporate them into our existing ideas"<p>— Kendra Cherry, The Importance of Assimilation in Adaptation</p></blockquote>

            <p class="card-text"> 
                <blockquote>"Development moves along in a state of equilibrium as we assimilate new information that we come across. But every once in a while we run into something that throws part of our world view into disarray. And this disequilibrium is what drives our learning process because we accommodate as a way to restore equilibrium"<p>—Schemas, assimilation, and accommodation </p></blockquote>
