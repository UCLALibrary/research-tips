<h3>About the Toolkit</h3>

Misinformation is a systemic issue. Its causes are varied and complex, and its solutions will be just as messy. Ready to dive in with us?

<p>We, the creators of this resource, believe that the best way to understand and combat misinformation is to create a collaborative learning environment that gives participants opportunities to reflect, share, and explore together. Rather than provide a checklist (“Ten Easy Steps to End Misinformation!”) or an authoritative overview (“Here’s What’s REALLY Up With Conspiracy Theories”) our goal is to help you facilitate conversations within your community. We hope that your goals will be to enable a nuanced understanding of misinformation and enact creative solutions in response.</p>

<h3>Who is the Toolkit for?</h3>

<p>Anyone who wants to facilitate learning about misinformation, e.g. course instructors, library staff, or student staff.</p>

<h3>How to use the Toolkit</h3>

<p>This resource is divided into three learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify the causes of misinformation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Define information, misinformation, and disinformation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Identify strategies for recognizing misinformation</strong></li>
</ul>
 
<p>For each outcome, we have provided a theoretical framework, learning activity examples, and resources for further exploration. The outcomes are designed to work individually, or in any combination or sequence that makes sense for your learning community. Any or all of the outcomes can form the basis of a standalone workshop or course about understanding misinformation, or be integrated into existing course curricula.</p> 

<p>This toolkit is designed to be generative, and we hope it will serve as a launching point for adapting, revising, and creating your own learning outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="Identify-the-causes-of-misinformation">Identify the causes of misinformation</h2>
<br>
<h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>The causes of misinformation extend beyond the individuals who create and disseminate it to encompass the entirety of our complex information ecosystem. In the learning activity below, we explore three aspects of this ecosystem and their contributions to the misinformation landscape: information overload, internet platform business models, and outdated internet literacy learning models. We encourage you and your learning community to explore other systemic causes of misinformation beyond what we present here.

<h2 id="Define-information-misinformation-disinformation">Define information, misinformation, and disinformation</h2>
<h3>Theoretical Framework</h3> 

The language we use matters. The terms misinformation and disinformation are not always interchangeable and each come with their own set of implications about the intent of the sharer, the information’s level of veracity and factuality (or lack thereof), and the reliability of the source. The learning activity below helps learners define these terms and practice spotting examples.
