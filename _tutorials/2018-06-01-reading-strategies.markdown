<p>The way you read will vary depending on what you are reading and what you need to get out of the reading! This resource provides a bank of quick and practical reading strategies that can help you build your own reading strategies toolbox. </p>

<p>Pick one or two of the reading strategies below and try them out on your next reading assignment! Notice the strengths of the reading strategies and in what contexts they works best for you. You can always return here to try out a new reading strategy when your needs change later on!</p>


<!-- this is a comment, we use comments to write notes that only appear in code -->
<!-- we also use comment to mark off sections of code to make things easier to read and scan -->
<!-- for example, in the code below, there is a start statement and an end statement to help us scan and read through the code. -->

                    <li>Gauge the quantity of reading and the time you have to read it.</li>

                <li>Schedule breaks or give yourself rewards every few pages or minutes during long reading sessions.</li>
                <li>Find a suitable reading environment. You can reserve study rooms here in the <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/clicc/study-rooms" target="blank">library</a> or <a href="https://reslife.ucla.edu/reserve/" target="blank">residential halls</a>.</li>

            <p class="card-text"> Figuring out what information you need from a reading is an important first step! It can help you know when to speed up and when to slow down and dive deeper into the reading. </p>
                 <ul class="browser-default activator"><li>Slow down your reading when you encounter unfamiliar ideas or new information that seems particularly relevant to your class or research context.</li>
                 <li>Increase speed when you encounter ideas that you are familiar with or that don’t pertain to your research context or class.</li>
                 <li>You can use key phrases to identify when to change your  speed. For example, if you already understand the concept, you can speed up when you see the phrase “for example.” But you might want to slow down when you see something like “Conversely” which indicates a shift or new perspective.</li>

                <li>If you cannot move forward in the text without understanding the meaning of a certain word, look it up now. </li>
                 <li>If a word is frequently repeated within a text, but you can still understand the text from context clues, it’s probably worth looking up later. Circle it and come back later.</li>
                 <li>Words that are only used once and don’t crucially impact your understanding of the text don’t need to be addressed right away. Don't let them distract you from the broader meaning of the text.</li>
                     <li>Develop a system for making your vocabulary easily accessible, like a circle that means "look up later."</li>
